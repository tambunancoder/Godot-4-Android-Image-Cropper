This is Android Image Cropper Plugin for Godot 4.

Download the GodotImageCropperPlugin.zip addons from  [release page](https://github.com/tambunancoder/Godot-4-Android-Image-Cropper/releases) and extract it in your project.

Please download the Demo project and open it in Godot to learn how to use it. It is pretty simple and straightforward actually.

This plugin was made using:

CanHub/Android-Image-Cropper (For cropping the image)
& bumptech/glide (For loading the image)

This is my first commit and will be updated.
